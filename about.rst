About me
========

My name is Artem Egorkine and I am a software developer based in Helsinki,
Finland. I am interested in open source, web applications, computer 
graphics, operating systems and so on. This blog is mostly a result of my
programming escapades, hosting the little bits of knowledge that I hope
may be useful for other developers.

I have written code in C, C++, C#, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby... you name it!
Contrary to the strong initial dislike of python, over the time I found
myself doing all my personal projects in Python.

You can find me at `github <http://github.com/arteme>`_, 
`bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/arteme>`_ and freenode as *arteme*.

The site is powered by `rstblog <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>`_, a
static blog generator. The theme is a mixture of `Armin Ronacher blog 
<http://lucumr.pocoo.org/>`_ theme, `Guido Kollerie blog
<http://blog.kollerie.com/>`_ theme and my own tinkering. The theme can
be found in the source tree of this blog.
